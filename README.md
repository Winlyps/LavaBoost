# LavaBoost
Required Plugin: https://modrinth.com/plugin/kotlinplugins
- Everytime player steps/moves into the lava, the fire resistance effect for 15 seconds will be applied.
- The purpose of this plugin is to make impossible death through lava-burning ( unless you don't move in the lava ). It introduces something new - lava travelling!
